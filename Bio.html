    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>When humans experience hardship or traumas they often shutdown and  go down a rabbit hole of chaos, however those with courage persevere. My father and mother who walked barefoot as children taught me to fight. I live my life not for glory nor riches but to help myself and those around me live a safe, complete, peaceful and fulfilling life. </p>
    <p>My family immigrated to the US in the late 80s due to economical reasons. I was raised in a conservative Mexican family; a father working 7 days week and a mother that educated her children with a belt and a bible. Thus, during my childhood I was not allowed to leave my home. As a result my computer became my best friend. ”Ohh , the good old days.” Where mp3’s took 20 minutes to download and 39 other people from all over the world  get together on Sunday to Slay mythical monsters in World of Warcraft.</p>
    <p>To my parents work was a very important trait and my first entrepreneur venture was staged in middle school selling candies to fellow classmates. I worked in a range of jobs from selling “Elotes” (sweet corn) on the street to working in construction jobs. Unfortunately, I felt shun from white collar jobs or a college education as an illegal alien . I voluntary repatriated back to Mexico, here I found challenges and freedom. </p>
